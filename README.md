# Rideshare-Project

## Program Description

This program simulates a road populated with 32 stations, 50 people, and either 20 or 40 cars, depending on the simulation. Cars and people want to go to an ending station. A car can hold up to 3 people. It picks up anyone going in the same direction and drops them off at their ending station. At a station, passengers are grouped into going right, left, or finished. Once the car reaches its end, it drops of everyone and joins its end station's finished group.

## Simulation Results
- 20 Car Sim Passenger Completion Rate: 0.57412
- 40 Car Sim Passenger Completion Rate: 0.78528

## Favorite Parts of Program

I am very proud of my station class. It took the most work by far. The method that I am most proud of is staiton's sendPassengers. It took a while to figure out how to loop through the passengers and assign them to the correct car. Station was also where I encountered the most challenges.
